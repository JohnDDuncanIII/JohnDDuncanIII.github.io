desc/cl-bgnd/Textures   Desktop Textures Inclusion

Geoff Adams <gadams@avernus.com> and  Stephen Krauth <phred@avernus.com>
has kindly allowed the inclusion of this small part of the Desktop
Textures, in the library. However please not that this is not the whole of
that library but only parts which were donated to the AIcons Library.
These are 128x128 color backgrounds which while a bit large for this
collection are included as they are extremely useful, and great looking.

These images are copyright and can not be included into any package
without first contacting Geoff before hand.  He has provided a copyright
notice which is included in this directory.

WARNING: These images use a huge number of colors which can fill your
color table completely. Thus leaving no colors available for other X window
application.  As such before using them as a background pattern you may
beed to reduce the number of colors they are using. Most of these pattern
will still look good if you quantify the colors to say 24 or so.

Part of your package includes a number of our Desktop Textures.  Since
we take pride in this product and hold a copyright on it, we have a
request concerning your distribution of our work.

I brought this up once before, and I appreciate your response at that
time.  What you did at the time was include my name in your
README.contrib file, which was better than nothing.  However, at least
several people have found your icon library and used our textures in
their products without even realizing that they were using
distribution-restricted material.

Our two restrictions are thus:

	* We (Geoff Adams and Stephen Krauth) are fully credited as
the creators of the textures, and our permission is granted for
distribution.

	* The textures do not wind up gracing the screens of Windows
machines.

Here at Glue, we keep the textures in a directory with a README file,
which contains the information we wish to be distributed with the
textures.  We would like you to include something similar in your
distribution, *in the directory which contains the textures*, so I
will include our README below.

Thank you,

Geoff Adams
