This group of images are simply my favorite from the University of Kansas Medical Center, as archived by Henry Stilmack from the University of Hawaii. Old archive was located at http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/~hps/clipart/ (dead link), and is now located at https://www.eao.hawaii.edu/~hps/clipart/. The original archive from the 90â€™s can be located here: http://web.archive.org/web/20000301015951/www.rad.kumc.edu/icons/icons.htm.
