\b\fc0\cf0 Ahh, the creative frenzy...  or was it a plagaristic frenzy?  I can't decide.\
\
I wont mention where I got these, but I scanned 'em in 
\b0 (Scan-X, the program in need of redesign)
\b  and shrunk 'em up 
\b0 (WetPaint, only shrinks in whole numbers %-/)
\b  and alphaized 
\b0 (Icon, I just find it a bit simpler than WetPaint)\

You may still like to doctor the edges a bit, but I don't mind 'em.\
