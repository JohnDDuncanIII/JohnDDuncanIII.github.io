* This is Version 1.21 of 3d_pixmaps - GNU Public licence release
  
  - This version adds some new pixmaps contributed by different people.
    Unfortunatly, I don't have the names of those people anymore to
    remember them all. Sorry folks. If someone sent me some 3dpixmaps,
    just resend me an EMail and I'll include your names.
  - Changed the Licence policy. This release will go under the GNU Public
    licence. Have a look at the file COPYRIGHT for more informations.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* This is Version 1.2 of 3d_pixmaps - Move over to a Desktop Environement.

  - This version is mostly a Configuration enhancement. I adapted it to fit
    better in the RedHat Distribution sheme using RPM.
  - Added some more Configuration files (Samples for fvwm2)
  - Adapted 3dpixmaps to fit better in fvwm2-2.0.43
  - Added some Sounds for use with FvwmAudio, the Sample fvwm2rc fits
    with these Sounds. If anyone has some better sounds, please let me know
    & send them to me :)
  - Also took the LiNUX 2.0 xterm-pixmap and made an 3dpixmap of it. There´s
    also a Shell2-linux.xpm pixmap. Hav a look at this one. I like it :)

  Most of the Below packages can be found at Smurphy's ftp Site:
  ftp://pc50.zrz.tu-berlin.de/pub/local

  - RPM Packages that should be installed:
    o fvwm2-2.0.43-1.i386.rpm
    o fvwm2-modules-2.0.43-1.i386.rpm
    o coolmail-1.3-3.i386.rpm
    Note: These 2 Packages below are an enhancement to RedHats setup & skel
          packages. They will fit and try to autoconfigure almost 
          automatically, but might need a --force since a bashrc is included.
    o setup-1.3-4.i386.rpm
    o etcskel-1.1-4.i386.rpm

  - Non RPM Packages, maybe someone makes some one Day ?
    o A package that Contains splay, haven´t found one though.
      Maybe someone sometime will make one ???
    o oclock - Haven't found the source yet, I still have a Binary though.
      If someonefinds the Source, or has an Old version of rxvt where the
      source is still in, could he send me a cutdown containing the 
      specified Code ?


    And, as Usuall, I'm glad to hear any Comments (critics) and Ideas how to
    Improve this package. If you have any enhancement (Tip for the 
    fvwm-configuration, a programm that can improove the Value of this Desktop,
    just let me know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* This is Version 1.1 of 3d_pixmaps

- This version has only _some_ more Pixmaps, and a little enhancement 
  in file, for easyer RPM build.

- Wrote a little Makefile for easyer installation :) Just have a look at 
  the Makefile and set the Destination Directories right.

- Found out who the original Author of the first Pixmaps I found was.
  The Pixmaps came from MagicWB, Martin Huttenloher <xen@magic.in-ulm.de>.
  Unfortunatly he has never answered Mails sent to him. Maybe if someone 
  knows him he'll tell him to contact me ? <thx>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* This is Version 1.0 of 3d_pixmaps

- OK Folks. I guess here I am again, this time (I hope) with the final
  Version of 3d Icons. The big Jump came, because I found a great way
  in Creating a huge number of new icons.

Enhancements 0f 1.0:

  - A complete bunch of new Icons. In fact, I converted some old 2d pixmaps
    and integrated them on the Template-pixmap. So, you got about 3,5 Megs
    of Icons. Of course, all with their respective mini-icon ;)
  - For 8 bit Display Users:
    I made 2 Packages availiable. Package 1 -> 3dpixmaps_100colors has
    all icons reduced to use only 100 Colors in all. They also look
    good, even if some Icons losst a little bit of their shapeness :(
  - For >= 16 bit Display Users:
    Unfortunatly, the color-reduction leaved some Icons in a way I
    didn't like (Modified clearness a bit), so I decided to make a 2nd
    Version availiable. This one uses all original colors with no
    colormap-reduction. Have a look at Package 2 -> 3dpixmaps !
  - Note: Using the 100 Colors reduced Icons speeds up X-Starting
    considerably. 

So Enjoy the Icons, and if someone wants some own integrated, send me
a mail ;)

* This is Version 0.11 of 3d_pixmaps

Enhancements of 0.11:  
  - A little Cleanup, in fact, some non 3d pixmaps where remaining
    and I took them out.
  - Also, finally crated am own colormap for all pixmaps. They are using
    100 Colors all together, so it should be O.K.
    (If someone needs a smaller colormap, please contact me).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* This is my Version 0.1 of 3d_pixmaps distribution.
  including pixmaps in 3d Look with their respective mini-pixmap

* These are not mine (Well not all). I first found a bunch, then created
my own ! This is no Commercial Product, free (For everyone to use) and
I take absolutely no warranty if anything bad happens to your system !
Like the monitor blowing up because it got too many Colours presented
a.s.o ...) ;)

* Just wanted to contribute a little bit to the fvwm-Stuff :)
In Fact, while parsing through different Unix-System, I discovered
some nice looking 3d_featured pixmaps. Unfortunatly they weren't
enough, so I decided to create some own.

* It happened to also have a 3d Template pixmap, which helped me to
create my own. Unfortunatly, I didn't manage to get the combine to
center the original pixmap onto the template, what I resolved by
resizing the original first. A bad sideeffect is, that it has some
quality losses after resizing :( If someone knows a better solution, 
let me know ;)

* To use the Make3dxpm you'll need the Marvellous Imagemagick-Package,
since the tools Make3dxpm uses are taken from there ...

* In fact, What I never liked with all the XPM's lying around, was their
different sizes so you could'nt get an arranged Desktop. So, "we" have to
decide  of a size for all icon's. I choosed 56x46 pixels, since the
Real-Good looking ones I found have this size :) and I wouldn't
destroy the good-looking by resizing them. Mini-Pixmaps are also
included from all existing pixmaps in this directory. 

* Be warned that these pixmaps let your X-Server working very hard and
it can takes almost to 1 minute to have a picture on the screen after
a startx. This on a i486-DX4-100MHz with 32 MB Ram.



TODO -
- I'm using these pixmaps (have a look at my system.fvwmrc file) on an
  16 bit Display, so it might be to much colours for 8 Bit
  displays. Unfortunatly, many programms don't want to create a
  Colourmap since many xpm's don't have a name. Have to fiddle arround a
  bit 'til I find a solution for it. When I found it, I'll reduce colour
  consumption to 50 Colours for all images.


TODO - for the Fvwm Programmers
- What I'd like the fvwm-Programmers to do is to find a way (Should be
  pretty easy though) to integrate the pixmap automatically from the
  name of the application.
  By example, instead of having: 
  +               "%mini.fvwm.xpm%FvwmConfig" Module FvwmConfig
  just insert:
  +               "FvwmConfig" Module FvwmConfig
  And fvwm knows that the pixmaps is FvwmConfig.xpm, and the mini.icon
  is mini.FvwmConfig.xpm
  This would mean a lot of Pixmap renaming, but at least, if you
  already got some pixmaps for an application, fvwm recognises it
  right away without users to fiddle around for integrating new
  pixmaps. Wouldn't it be a good idea ?

=> Answer from the FvwmMailing list was that it won't be taken in.
   Feature to put it in manually already exists.

  
For any hints and good-ideas, email me ;)
Have fun ...
