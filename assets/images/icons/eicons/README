eicons-1.0 [1999.01.27] V C Hui

  Gnome Look Alike Icons:
  -----------------------

    I have made a number of icons which based on 
    the i-regular.png and i-director.png from mc-4.5.6
    and from the traditional xfm sources.

    This collection of icons consumed only 16 colors
    which included major colors like, black, white, red,
    green, blue and yellow.

    My aim was to create a set of icons which are 
    visually coherent and reflect a functional
    consistency about their properties.
    (see READM.pixmaps for a full comment)


  Contents:
  ---------

    pixmaps/
      pixmaps for general use;

    xfm.bitmaps/ xfm.pixmaps:
      replacements bitmaps and pixmaps for xfm
      offix-files or other derivatives for visual
      compatibility with the new pixmaps in pixmaps/; 
      (see README.xfm.*i*maps for details)

    dnd-cursor/
      replacements bitmaps for offix's dndlib;
      (see README.dnd-cursor for detail);


  Notes:
  ------

    It is necessary to recompile xfm, offix-files and
    dndlib in order to make the full use of the new
    pixmaps and bitmaps;  It should be straight forward.

    The "Makefile"s included with this package are mainly
    for archive management and do not do any installation.

    The first letter 'e' in eicons has no meaning.

    Thanks to the GNOME team for creating the basic
    file and directory icons in the first place.
