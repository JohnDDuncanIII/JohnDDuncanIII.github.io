Hello!

Here are a couple of fresh icons for KDE.
Four categories follow...

First, some screensaver magic:
-------------------------------------------------------
NeriLock.xpm - ORCA-logo for the Ocean-Girl screensaver
TenchiLock.xpm - icon for the Tenchi-Muyo screensaver

These are for various X-Teddy derivates:
-------------------------------------------------------
Xayeka.xpm - icon for XAyeka (a.k.a. XAeka)
Xdelenn.xpm - icon for XDelenn
Xryoohki.xpm -  icon for XRyo-Ohki
Xsheridan.xpm - icon for XSheridan
Xteddy.xpm - icon for XTeddy

Cool icons for cool applications:
-------------------------------------------------------
scanner.xpm - icon for programs like XscanImage
The_Gimp.xpm - you should know what this one is for...
mpg.xpm - for anything involving MPEG audio/video (like X11amp)

And finally, some device icons:
-------------------------------------------------------
dvdrom_mount.xpm
dvdrom_unmount.xpm

By the way, If anyone would like to do a KDE-port of my
two screensavers "NeriLock" and "TenchiLock", you can get the
sourcecode here:
http://131.220.158.19/~neo/xtenchi.html (TenchiLock)
http://131.220.158.19/~neo/UbriStayOut/island.html (NeriLock)
Basically, these are just modified "xlockmore"-versions.
