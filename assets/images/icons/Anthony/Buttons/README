appl/www/Buttons   World Wide Web Buttons

These are buttons which can be used on WWW html documents for the creation
of ``Button Banks''. All the buttons follow the style initially set out by
Greg Bossert, of Rutgers University.

Example Button Bank:

<BLOCKQUOTE> Where do you want to go now?... <BR>
<!-- Go to the main home page of server -->
<A HREF="/"><IMG SRC="/images/Buttons/home.gif" ALT="[home]"
        WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 ALIGN=middle></A>
<!-- Exit this room via a door (up one directory) -->
<A HREF="../"><IMG SRC="/images/Buttons/door_exit.gif" ALT="[exit]"
        WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 ALIGN=middle></A>
<!-- go to my hotlist -->
<A HREF="hotlist.html"><IMG SRC="/images/Buttons/hotlist.gif" ALT="[hotlist]"
        WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 ALIGN=middle></A>
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Almost all the icons were created by taking a 32x32 image from the
desc/cl-32 icon area, giving it a grey background and wrapping it in
a four pixel wide `button' border. Of course others were created by me
using bits and pieces from all over.

NOTE: all these icons have been converted to the libraries standard color
table.
