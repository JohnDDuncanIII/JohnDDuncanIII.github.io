appl/www/Animate     Wide World Web -- Gif Animations

The files in this directory are GIF animations or source files for
generating GIF Animations. Current only the Netscape WWW client which
understands GIF files containing multiple images are animations.

NOTE: if you are reading this directory in the AIcons Source area some of
the files are special `.anim' animation sequencing files.  This files
contain the arguments for the ImageMagick convert program (version 3.7.3 or
later) to create GIF animations from the X Images in that directory.

For example to generate the  "aicons_anim.gif" GIF animation the
aicons.anim file is used to give arguments to `convert' as follows...

    convert `cat aicons.anim` $DEST/aicons_anim.gif

This is performed by the AIcons support script ``anim2gif''
