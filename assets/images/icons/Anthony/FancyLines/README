appl/www/FancyLines     Wide World Web -- Fancy Lines

This direct contains assorted fancy line to use as dividers on WWW
document pages.

The lines consist of some object forming a horizontal division across
the page. These lines are not a thin grove such as the ``Threaded Lines''
or a rectangular box such as `Plain or Textured Lines''. They are sort of
midway between the two line styles and are fairly `free form'' in what
is done.
