      The `gem' balls were developed from his game ``XMirrorMagic''
      found in ftp.x.org. Note however that these balls as very common
      in the games world for buttons and detail.

     The initial red and black balls with a black border around them
     as a different, cleaner and neater ball shading style. These
     are the   b_{color}.xpm files in this directory.
