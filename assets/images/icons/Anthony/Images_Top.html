<H1>Anthony's WWW Images (Framed)
<BR>Version 2.0</H1>

<BR CLEAR=all>

<H2>Welcome</H2>

The goal of this Image library is to...

<CENTER><B> `` Provide a BASE set of images for WWW use '' </B></CENTER>

It is NOT a be all and end all collection of WWW images. I let the huge number
of other WWW image libraries, attempt and fail to do this.  Instead this is a
starting set of images, that starting web sites can use and expand from. <P>

In accordance with this goal I do not provide banners, logos or any background
pattern images. Any such image I supply would rarely be used by a new web site
as these one of the things which each web site uses to make their site unique
and different from everyone elses. <P>

Also since it was created the library contents has not changed in any major
way. Only the occasional small group of images have been added due to general
need. <P>

<H2>Source Library</H2>

All the images in this directory tree have been converted to the GIF format
from the source library, <A HREF="http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/icons/"
TARGET="_top"><B> Anthony's Icon Library </B></A>.  Please feel free to take
a visit and download any and all icons you find there. WARNING: this library
is for X Window users, as such images are stored in X Window formats which
is not directly suitable for WWW or PC use.  (See ``<A
HREF="http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/icons/pc_x_images.shtml" >PC Image
Conversions</A>'' for information on using this on PCs). <P>

The ``ReadMe'' file within each sub-directory lists any known original
source of images or image sets, in that directory, if known. <P>

<H2>Downloading</H2>

Netscape users can download a displayed image by pressing the rightmost mouse
button over the image so that a menu appears. Users on Macs and PC's do the
same but hold the (only or one) button for a couple of seconds.  You can then
select the ``Save Image'' option in this popup menu. For other client users,
some of the images are linked so just selecting the image will (depending on
your client) download the image to a local viewer. <P>

To make downloading these icons easier, I have provided the following
GZIp'ed Tar Archives of Anthony's WWW Images...

PC Users can look at 
``<A HREF="http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/icons/pc_gzip_tar.shtml">
De-Archiving GZip'ed Tar Archives on PCs</A>'' for information on how to
handle the above archives. Also in 
``<A HREF="http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/icons/pc_x_images.shtml">
PC Image Conversions</A>'' is a summery for converting X window and GIF
images for PC use. <P>

<B>For Mirror Coordinators</B> I have written a small shell script called
<A HREF="http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/icons/support/images_mirror">
<B>"images_mirror"</B></A> which uses the lynx WWW client to download the
above tar file and automatically unpack it. This will allow you to set up a
`cron job' to automatically download and un-tar these images on a regular
basis for use on your server. The script is VERY simple and you should have
no problem modifying it if necessary. <P>
