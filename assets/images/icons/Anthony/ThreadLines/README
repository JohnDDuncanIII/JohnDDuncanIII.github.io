appl/www/ThreadLines     Wide World Web -- Threaded Lines

This direct contains assorted fancy line to use as dividers on WWW
document pages.

A group of these lines follow a partucualar style of a simple groove or
string with some feature attached. The lines: bow, bubble, cut, eyes,
music, owl, runner, and tap,  were the original set of fancy lines which
were created by  David Bouman. (See below)

Since then numerous other people have created lines of similar style,
unfortuantly with the web the way it is it is very difficult to discover
the original authors.
