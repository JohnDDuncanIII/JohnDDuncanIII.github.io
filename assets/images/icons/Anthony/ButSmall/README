appl/www/ButSmall   World Wide Web Buttons (Small)

These are buttons which can be used on WWW html documents for the creation
of very small ``Button Banks''. All the buttons follow the style initially
set out by Greg Bossert, of Rutgers University, for this sized buttons.

Example Button Bank:

<BLOCKQUOTE> Where do you want to go now?... <BR>
<!-- Go to the main home page of server -->
<A HREF="/"><IMG SRC="/images/ButSmall/home_blue.gif" ALT="[home]"
        WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=middle></A>
<!-- Exit this room via a door (up one directory) -->
<A HREF="../"><IMG SRC="/images/ButSmall/up.gif" ALT="[exit]"
        WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=middle></A>
<!-- send me mail -->
<A HREF="mail.html"><IMG SRC="/images/ButSmall/mail.gif" ALT="[mail]"
        WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=middle></A>
<!-- help! -->
<A HREF="help.html"><IMG SRC="/images/ButSmall/question.gif" ALT="[help]"
        WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=middle></A>
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Almost all the icons were created by hand using a small 12x12 image
and wrapping it in a 3 pixel wide border. These buttons are only
ment for small unimportant button banks at the bottom of documents.
See the ../Buttons area for larger sized buttons.
