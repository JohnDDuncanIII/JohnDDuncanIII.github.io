www     Wide World Web Server Icons

This README is copied with the icons images to three possible places

Original Source for Icons in the Library...  
http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/icons/www/
   This directory is a SOURCE directory of the World Wide Web icons and as
   such is in the libraries own format X Bitmaps and X Pixmaps.
   CONTINUED BELOW

   The WWW set is designed as a basic set for new web sites, it is a
   basic set to provide a starting point and a consistant set for
   developing sites. It does not contain every icon in existance, nor
   does it contain banners or backgrounds which are very site dependant,
   being the things which make individual site unique (icon wise).

CIT Server on www.cit.gu.edu.au...
   All the icons in the above library WWW area have been converted to
   GIF format, via an automated installation script (not published).
   Transparency on X pixmaps and white on X bitmaps have been converted to
   a transparent grey color in the resulting GIF file. (See below).

   WARNING: This installation script can remove old obsolete images if
   requested. Only the GIF files in this directory which are never
   removed or replaced are those which START WITH A CAPITAL LETTER.
   These are classed as local additions to this server, make your own
   additions the same way.

A Copy of these icons on a Remote Server...
   That says it all. This README is therefore obsolete, and it is up to
   the Webmaster or owner of these directories to do whatever is
   required.  ``Images.html'' files in each of the subdirectories
   provide image examples, indexing, and the README introduction.

   I would however recommend that a new copy of these icons be
   downloaded from  http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/images/Images.html every
   couple of months or so.

   The "Images.html" file is WWW frame compliant (read NetScape)
   and is generated from the source "Images.m4" file, along with
   "Images_Index.html" and "Images_Top.html", etc.  For more information
   see the top comments of the "Images.m4" file on how this generation
   is done.

   The "Images_Ext.html" file is to display to External users who are
   not allowed to use the Example Image Pages Provided. The file
   "LocalOnly.htaccess" file is a example .htaccess file which will
   redirect non-local users to the "Ext" file instead of the Example
   pages.

AIcons Library README...      AIcons directory ``www''

This directory is a SOURCE directory of the World Wide Web icons and as
such is in the libraries own format of X Bitmaps and X Pixmaps.

However the Web prefers its images in the GIF format and as such when
installing the icons you convert them to this format with appropriate
transparency arrangements. See below.

The .html files in this directory are designed for use in the /images
directory of a Http Web Server as ``Image Examples''.  See our own
``Server Information'' document on http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/http/
The top level of the "Images*.html" files are also generated from the
file "Images.cpp" (See the comments in this file).

The links in this files are full paths so that client programs looking at
these files can find the GIF images in the current servers /images area
regardless of if reading from the actual library directory and to keep
web spiders happy. (A Kludge)

A gzip'ed tar file of all these icons is available from
    ftp://ftp.cit.gu.edu.au/pub/AIcons/WWW_Images.tar.gz

Some X Pixmap files are also using the ``Transparent'' or ``None'' color
available in this format. To properly convert these icons into GIF files
with the correct transparency setting for most WWW clients, you are
recommended to use the "xbm2gif" script which can be found in the
"support/scripts" section of this library. This script is not stand alone
and relies on one other script ("x2p.sed") and the PbmPlus filter library
(see main library README) to be present on your shell's PATH.

This script ("xbm2gif") has a -t option to handle these special Pixmaps.
The script first converts the X Pixmap `Transparent' color and the `white'
color of X bitmaps into a Grey shade, and then set this as the GIF's
transparent color in the final conversion phase. The resulting GIF will
then to be usable by the maximum number of clients including those which
do not understand the GIF transparency extension.

Example Conversion
  Convert bitmaps into Gifs (white becoming transparent)
    xbm2gif -t [a-z]*.xbm
  Convert pixmaps into Gifs (with appropriate transparency)
    xbm2gif -t [a-z]*.xpm

The "xbm2gif" script above checks if transparency is actually required
before applying converting them correctly and appropriately into GIF. This
is necessary due to the way older versions of some clients, such as mosaic,
mishandle the colors close to but not exactly the transparent color if
present.

    The original 40x40 and 20x20 button icons in the ``appl/www'' area.
    About half of these in this section are his icons including the
    arrows, homes, gopher, images, etc. and also the basic style and
    philosophy of these images.
       I and other users on the WWW have added many many more to this set
    by editing various ``desc/cl-32'' icons into the appropriate button
    style. NOTE: all these icons have been converted to the libraries
    standard color table.
