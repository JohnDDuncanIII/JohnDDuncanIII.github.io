appl/www/Lines     Wide World Web -- Lines (Plain and Textured)

This is a collection of plain and textured lines to use a general
boundary separators on the WWW.

Also see the other line section ``FancyLines'', very simple lines which
containing a picture of some sort (see FancyLines). Note the boarder
between these to sections while reasonable clear is not precise.

The lines in this section has come from all over the web. I have tried
to mention where or the author for a particular line but a lot have
slipped through the cracks.
