                <h1>A Manifesto for the Truth</h1>
                <h3>Edward Snowden, November 04, 2013</h3>
            </center>
            <p><i>This article by Edward Snowden was published Sunday in</i> Der Spiegel. </p>
            <p> In a very short time, the world has learned much about unaccountable secret 
                agencies and about sometimes illegal surveillance programs. Sometimes the agencies 
                even deliberately try to hide their surveillance of high officials or the public. 
                While the NSA and GCHQ seem to be the worst offenders - this is what the currently 
                available documents suggest - we must not forget that mass surveillance is a 
                global problem in need of global solutions. </p>
            <p> Such programs are not only a threat to privacy, they also threaten freedom 
                of speech and open societies. The existence of spy technology should not determine 
                policy. We have a moral duty to ensure that our laws and values limit monitoring 
                programs and protect human rights.</p>
            <p> Society can only understand and control these problems through an open, respectful 
                and informed debate. At first, some governments feeling embarrassed by the revelations 
                of mass surveillance initiated an unprecedented campaign of persecution to supress 
                this debate. They intimidated journalists and criminalized publishing the truth. 
                At this point, the public was not yet able to evaluate the benefits of the revelations. 
                They relied on their governments to decide correctly.</p>
            <p> Today we know that this was a mistake and that such action does not serve 
                the public interest. The debate which they wanted to prevent will now take place 
                in countries around the world. And instead of doing harm, the societal benefits 
                of this new public knowledge is now clear, since reforms are now proposed in 
                the form of increased oversight and new legislation.</p>
            <p> Citizens have to fight suppression of information on matters of vital public 
                importance. To tell the truth is not a crime.</p>
